ReadMe for CS5010 Programming Design Paradigms(PDP)

1. Assignment and Lab requirements are in the folder ```Requirement```.

2. Assignment5 has two different implementations, the ```Assignment5``` is for representation, the ```Assignment5AnotherImplementation``` just for fun. But the ```Assignment5AnotherImplementation``` is better and in the next assignments we have applied design like it.

3. Assignment7 is a sentence generator. In Assignment8 we need use the Assignment7 as a jar and call it to generate a sentence to send into the ChatRoom, so we should do some little changes to the Assignment7: change the read file part and generate logic to give us a insult sentence successfully;  change its ```build.gradle``` to give us a workable independent jar file. The changed Assignment7 is ```Assignment7ForAssignment8```.

4. No Lab3 because it's too easy.
